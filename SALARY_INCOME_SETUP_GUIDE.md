## ðŸš€ **Setup Steps**

### **Step 1: Run Database Schema**

```

This creates:

- Automatic triggers for expense/investment deductions

### **Step 2: Add Your Salary**

   - **Pay Day**: Select "10" (for 10th of every month)
   - **Next Pay Date**: Set your next salary date
   - **Start Date**: When this salary started
4. **Click "Add Salary"**

### **Step 3: Verify Setup**

After adding salary, you should see:
- âœ… **Salary Balance Card** on dashboard showing your full salary amount
- âœ… **"Add Salary" button** in dashboard header
- âœ… **Automatic deductions** when you add expenses/investments
